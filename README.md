# -Chemical-Reaction-Quiz-Game-Real-Time-Educational-Software-for-Chemistry-Learners
Developed a cross-platform interactive educational application using Python and PyQt5 to gamify the learning of chemical reactions. The game presents real-time quizzes based on a dynamic CSV database of chemical reactions, providing timed challenges, reaction hints, sound effects, and visual aid through a built-in 3D periodic table.


# ðŸ§ª Chemical Reaction Quiz Game

An interactive, real-time quiz game for chemistry students, built with Python and PyQt5. It helps users learn chemical reactions through gamified challenges, scoring, and visual feedback.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Real-time timer-based quiz system
- Reaction hints and learning feedback
- Scoreboard and high score tracking
- CSV-driven reaction database for easy updates
- Integrated 3D periodic table (QWebEngineView)
- Sound effects for feedback
- Score history log for performance tracking

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This
Chemistry learning can be repetitive and hard to visualize. This game makes it engaging by turning reactions into an interactive challenge, offering a mix of repetition, feedback, and visual aid. It's ideal for students, teachers, and self-learners.

## ðŸ›  Technologies
- Python 3
- PyQt5
- Qt WebEngine
- CSV for data management
